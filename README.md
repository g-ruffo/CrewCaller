# CrewCaller
Built with Kotlin, this Android application allows users to track their work schedule and earnings while providing local weather data using a RESTful API and the deviceâ€™s location. Users can schedule upcoming and past workdays with their start and wrap times and the application will automatically provide a summary of the total hours worked and earnings for each production. 

You can choose to view:
- Next scheduled work day
- A list of all recorded work days and details
- A list of productions and their summaries 
- A list of saved contacts
- A list of customized pay rates
- A calendar view with days worked highlighted
